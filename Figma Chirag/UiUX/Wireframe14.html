        Skill-based charity is a new way of giving where people donate money
        based on completed challenges or tasks that showcase their skills.
        Instead of just donating directly, individuals use their talents—like
        painting, coding, singing, or sports—to complete challenges. When they
        succeed, others donate to support their effort and a good cause.
        <br />
        For example:
